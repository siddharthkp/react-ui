            I'd like to be good at design but it has eluded me for a long time.
            I considered it a creative art form and not science.

            In my attempt to make design more approachable for myself, I
            discovered a few concepts that "just clicked". I have tried to bake
            them into react-ui to make design approachable for more developers
            like myself.

          There are a few concepts that let you approach design from a systems
          point of view than a pure art point of view.

            At the core of every well crafted interface is a set of constraints
            that help in creating a certain level of consistency and quality.

          <Text>
            Constraints help build consistent features at a faster pace by
            moving decisions into reusable patterns.

            By using culturally relevant, historically pleasing ratios to create
            modular scales and basing the measurements in our compositions on
            values from those scales, we can achieve a visual harmony not found
            in layouts that use arbitrary, conventional, or easily divisible
            numbers â€”{' '}

          <Text>Let's take an example of this Airbnb-esque form:</Text>

            Focus on the space between elements. There are two kinds of
            decisions that are worth noticing:

        </Para>
        <Para>
          <Text>1. Consistency in space</Text>
          <Text>
            The input and buttons are of the same size, the space between form
            elements is always the same, the space between a label and its
            corresponding form element is the same, etc.
          </Text>
        </Para>
        <Para>
          <Text>2. The space values are on a scale</Text>
          <Text>
            - If you look closely, this design only uses 5 space values:{' '}
            <Code>[8, 16, 24, 32, 48]</Code>. All of the space units are
            multiples of 8, in other words, these values are <i>on a scale</i>.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            The smallest space is between a label and input field, 1 unit = 8px.
            To create diffrentiation between multiple fields, we need more
            space, bumping to the next unit of 2 = 16px does the job.

            You can promote this idea for all style properties - space, font
            sizes, colors, shadows, etc.
          </Text>
          <Text>For example, these font sizes are on a scale:</Text>

            To be able to represent these concept in code, we need the right the
            right abstractions.

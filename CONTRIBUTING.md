#### What should I know before I get started?

<br/>

It's helpful to read the post about [old and new ideas in React UI](https://react-ui.dev/core-concepts/ideas) to understand the concepts used in the project.

<br/><br/>

#### How can I contribute?

<br/>

1. Bug fixes: If you spot a bug in the codebase or in the documentation, please feel free to report it or create a pull request to fix it.

2. Documentation: If you encounter a section of the documentation which is unclear or simply incomplete, please feel free to reach out

3. Components: React UI has a small set of core components. Contributions to [the ecosystem](https://react-ui.dev/ecosystem) are more than welcome.

4. Examples: If you are building a website/application with React UI or have a prototype based on the [CodeSandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-ui-template-302iq), please feel free to share it with me.

#### How do I setup the project

<br/>

1. Clone the repository

   Run this command on your terminal:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/siddharthkp/react-ui.git
   ```

2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

   It's recommended to use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of npm because the project uses a `yarn.lock` file to make sure you get the exact version of dependencies as intended.

3. There are a few `packages` inside the repository. The interesting ones are:

   - packages/docs: This is the documentation site for React UI
   - packages/react-ui: This is the components package
   - packages/example: This is examples build with React UI

   Each of these have their own scripts inside `package.json`. For example, to work on the documentation website, you can run

   ```
   cd packages/docs
   yarn start
   ```

   You don't have to install dependencies again for each package. React UI uses [yarn workspaces(https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) - which means you can use the local version of react-ui package inside the documentation website.

4. The recommended way of testing a component is in by running the documentation site.

   To do this, start the docs site

   ```
    cd packages/docs
    yarn start
   ```

   and run react-ui in development mode

   ```
   cd packages/react-ui
   yarn dev
   ```

   Now, any changes made to the components or primitives will reflect in the documentation.

5. Builds and publishing

   To build the components package, run `yarn build` in `packages/react-ui`.

   The documentation site is automatically deployed from the base branch: `main`
